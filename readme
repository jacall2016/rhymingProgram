Overview
In the pursuit of advancing my skills as a software engineer and deepening my understanding of the TypeScript language, I developed a TypeScript project aimed at generating lists of rhyming words, synonyms, and antonyms based on a given input word. The project also includes a feature for producing lists of rhyming synonyms and antonyms. To showcase the functionality, I created a simple website using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.

Development Environment
For the development of this software, I employed the following tools:

Visual Studio Code: A versatile and efficient code editor that streamlined the development process.
TypeScript: The primary programming language for this project, chosen for its static typing and enhanced JavaScript features.
GitHub: A version control platform, essential for collaborative and organized software development.
Useful Websites
During the development, I found the following websites particularly helpful:

TypeScript Documentation: Comprehensive documentation for TypeScript syntax and features.
MDN Web Docs: Valuable resource for HTML and CSS documentation.
GitHub Guides: Useful guides for effective use of GitHub for version control.
Future Work
As I reflect on the project, I recognize areas for future improvement and expansion:

Integration with Dictionary API: Connecting to a free dictionary API to enhance the application with definitions, meanings, and pronunciation information.
User Interface Enhancement: Improving the website's interface to provide a more user-friendly experience.
Extended Error Handling: Refining error handling mechanisms, especially for cases where words cannot be extracted from the API.
For a detailed demonstration of the software and a walkthrough of the code, please refer to the Software Demo Video.
